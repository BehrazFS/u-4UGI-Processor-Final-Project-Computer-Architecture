# u-4UGI-Processorâ€“Final-Project-Computer-Architecture 
This repository contains the complete design and implementation of the u-4UGI 8-bit custom processor implemented in VHDL,  developed as the final project for the Computer Architecture course.

# ðŸ”§ Features
8 General Purpose Registers: R0 to R7, each 8-bit wide

8-bit ALU Operations: Supports arithmetic and logical operations

16-bit Instruction Format

512-byte Addressable Memory: Separate regions for data and program memory

Supported Instruction Set:

Arithmetic/Logic: Add, Sub, AddI, SubI, ADC, CMP, Xor, And, SHL, SHR

Memory Access: LD, ST

Control Flow: Br, BZ, BS, BNZ

# ðŸ§© Components Implemented
Instruction format design and encoding

Instruction Fetch and Decode Unit

Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

Program Counter (PC) management

Separate Memory Read/Write Unit for data and program memory

8-register Register File

Control Unit for instruction execution

Example machine code program for functional testing
